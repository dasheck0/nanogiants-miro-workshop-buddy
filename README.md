# Workshop Buddy
<!-- section: Introduction -->
<!-- Describe briefly what your software is. What problem does it solve? At what target audience is it aimed? -->

This is a miro plugin that helps you create workshops in miro with the power of AI.

By using the power of AI we tackled problems regarding creating compelling workshops for collaboration. We utilize both GPT-3.5 turbo and GPT-4 as well as function calling to let the user interact with our chatbot, who then creates custom tailored boards for your very own workshop. We have multiple agents in place, who are specialised for a dedicated task (i.e. planning, board creation, chat flows) to get the things done. Just chat with our chatbot, who tries to understand what you are trying to build and he interviews you in order to understand better. If he has enough knowledge, he creates the boards for your workshop for you. Update them if needed.

Workshop Buddy is your Miro collaboration game-changer, tackling the White Page Problem by transforming the daunting blank canvas into a streamlined and intuitive planning experience. No more staring at empty boards â€“ Workshop Buddy is here to revolutionize your workshop efficiency.

This innovative AI plugin boasts lightning-speed planning, structuring, and board creation, offering a user-friendly chat interface for seamless communication between the buddy and the human. It guides users to articulate their workshop goals effortlessly, ensuring a clear and organized foundation for collaborative work.

Beyond its planning prowess, Workshop Buddy is your go-to guide for elevating workshop quality. With expert insights, it turns workshops into valuable learning experiences, bridging knowledge gaps and steering facilitators away from common mistakes. Seasoned facilitator or workshop novice, Workshop Buddy grounds your approach in proven strategies, maximizing collaborative potential in Miro.

Looking forward, Workshop Buddy's next upgrade introduces theming, allowing users to easily align boards with corporate colors. Future plans extend beyond workshops and presentations, envisioning Workshop Buddy as a versatile companion for creating visuals, building roadmaps, and even exploring voice-driven functionality. Brace yourself for a future where Workshop Buddy transcends boundaries, redefining collaborative possibilities in Miro.
